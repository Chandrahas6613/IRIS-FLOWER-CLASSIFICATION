_Developed a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset consists of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the species of the flower. The classification task was performed using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, enabling the model to accurately predict the species of the flower based on new input data. This project provided valuable insights into supervised learning techniques and classification models._
